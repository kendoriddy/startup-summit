# startup-summit
This project is my first capstone project at Microverse. I will be building a website for the upcoming (fictional) Nigeria's first Entrepreneurship and Startup Management Summit

The goal of this project is to build a simple multi page responsive conference website which will be coming up later this year. The website will show all the necessary information concerning the conference including: the speakers, program of event, sponsors and other relevant information.

In this project, you are expected to setup Html-CSS-Javascript linter following the guidelines stated in the Html-CSS-Javascript linter config documentation, follow mobile first approach while building the website, make the website responsive on mobile and desktop, make website interactive, run tests and finally deploy.

The project will contain the homepage and about page.
